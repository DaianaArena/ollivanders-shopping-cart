# Ollivander's shopping cart

## About the project:

As a huge fan of Harry Potter, I've always been fascinated by the wizarding world and its magical artifacts. One of the most iconic locations in the series is Olivander's Wand Shop, where young witches and wizards are fitted for their wands.

Inspired by this magical universe, I decided to create a project that would showcase my skills as a frontend developer while paying homage to one of my favorite book series. That's how the idea for the Harry Potter Olivander's Shopping Cart in Vanilla JavaScript was born.

The project is a basic implementation of an online shopping cart for Olivander's store using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. Users can easily add and remove items from the cart, adjust quantities, and view the total price. The interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and make purchases.

Overall, this project was a fun way for me to combine my love for frontend development with my passion for the Harry Potter universe. I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed creating it. â™¥
